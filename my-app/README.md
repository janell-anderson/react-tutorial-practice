During my time at General Assembly I was able to learn about React. It felt like a whirlwind
while learning React since it was just only three weeks of fast learning that I could barely
keep up with. 

So to help myself get a better understanding of how React works now that the program is finished. I decided to take on React's tutorial directly from there site. I have a short list of what I expect to learn and what I've learned but it will grow as I go along.

## What I expect to Learn
- Get the basic understanding of how React works.
- Coding React and actually understanding it

## What I learned
- React components accepts single "props" (properties) with data that returns a React element. Each component is considered a functional.
- When using a constructor you must always call "super(props)".
- You setState inside of a constructor. When calling it in a component, React updates the child components inside of it.
